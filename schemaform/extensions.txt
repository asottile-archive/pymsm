These are the extensions to JSON-schema that I'm using in this:

Boolean, integer, number, and string properties have an optional 'label'
    property of type string which defaults to the field name title-cased.

Enum properties have an optional 'labels' property which is an array of strings
    corresponding to the enum choices.  It must have the same length as the
    choices.  If absent it defaults to the choices title-cased.
